# .NET Console Application with DependencyInjections - Template 

While working with MVC style applications it is common to use Dependency Injections.
However, this is not a standard for Console Applications (which makes sense).
But nevertheless, it is possible to use the same style of coding in console apps
as well, by doing some additional setups at the start of your project.

This project is a small template-like example of how this kind of implementation
could be handled (and yes, there are still a number of improvements that can be
added) - such as using Dependency Injections and data from appSettings.json files.

Additionally, few unit tests are also prepared to demonstrate how such implementation
can be tested out.
